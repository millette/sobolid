## WIP

Items can be added to the body, the layers are all there but in no specific order. That means if you add shoes, then socks, the socks will probably appear over the shoes. Multilayer items are a problem too since they're all added at once.

## Usage

```sh
$ pnpm install # or npm install or yarn install
```

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.local` and adapt according to your supabase config.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

Preview with `npm start` and visiting http://localhost:4173 (vs port 3000 for dev version).

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
